# Highlands HandyHelp Project Log

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## Summary
- Bootstrapped a Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4 project with TypeScript in the `HighlandsHandyHelp` workspace.
- Migrated the scaffold into the repository root, retained the supplied client logo, and purged unused starter assets.
- Implemented a single-page marketing experience featuring hero, services, values, mission, call-to-action, and contact sections tailored to Highlands HandyHelp LLC.
- Added reusable layout components (`Header`, `Footer`, `ContactForm`) and centralized site copy in `src/config/site.ts` for easy updates.
- Integrated a configurable Formspree submission flow with graceful fallback messaging when the endpoint is not yet provisioned.
- Adopted the self-hosted Inter variable font via `@fontsource-variable/inter` to keep builds self-contained (no external font fetches required).
- Executed linting and production builds to validate the codebase; addressed Turbopack panic (switching to the stable Webpack build) and Google Fonts network errors by self-hosting fonts.
- Curated a repository-friendly `.gitignore` to exclude transient build artifacts and local tooling caches.
- Resized the hero contact card to tighten vertical rhythm and remove excess negative space under the contact details.

## File & Module Notes
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json`
  - Project renamed to `highlands-handyhelp`.
  - Scripts updated to use standard `next dev` and `next build` for reliability.
  - Dependencies include `lucide-react` for iconography and `@fontsource-variable/inter` for typography.
- `src/config/site.ts`
  - Houses marketing copy, service categories, and value statements.
  - Service items map to Lucide icons through `icon` keys (`wrench`, `settings`, `leaf`, `sparkles`).
- `src/components/header.tsx`
  - Sticky navigation with responsive layout and direct call CTA.
  - Mobile view keeps navigation links visible and exposes a one-tap call button.
- `src/components/footer.tsx`
  - Summarizes the business and repeats contact info; includes copyright.
- `src/components/contact-form.tsx`
  - Client-side form with submission states (`idle`, `submitting`, `success`, `error`, `unconfigured`).
  - Posts form data to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` when available; otherwise prompts visitors to call/email.
- `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Composes all sections with gradient backgrounds, cards, and CTA strips.
  - Pulls localized copy from `siteConfig` and renders icons via the service icon map.
  - Sections are anchored (`#services`, `#values`, `#about`, `#contact`) for smooth nav jumps.
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Defines global metadata (Open Graph, Twitter, canonical URL placeholder) and wraps the page with semantic `<html>` / `<body>`.
  - Uses `font-sans` classes now that fonts are self-hosted.
- `src/app/globals.css`
  - Imports Tailwind + Inter variable font, declares design tokens, base gradients, and global typography/background styles.
- `.env.example`
  - Documents the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` variable expected for live form submissions.
- `public/hhh-logo.png`
  - Client-provided brand mark used across the site.
- `README.md`
  - Rewritten with stack details, setup steps, project structure, and deployment guidance.

## Implementation Details
- **Design Language**: Red/black/white palette inspired by the provided logo. Utilizes soft gradients, glassmorphism cards, and uppercase microcopy for a professional feel.
- **Hero Section**: Communicates the mission, provides immediate phone/email CTAs, and highlights core service promises.
- **Services Grid**: Four service cards sourced from `siteConfig.services` with matching Lucide icons and hover accents.
- **Values Section**: Reinforces differentiators (service, craftsmanship, kingdom impact) to build trust.
- **Mission Callout**: Quotes Colossians 3:23 and elaborates on the Highlands College roots.
- **CTA Banner**: Encourages quick scheduling with dual call-to-action buttons.
- **Contact Section**: Combines direct contact information with the configurable form.

## Environment & Configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id` when ready to capture submissions.
- Update `baseUrl` in `src/app/layout.tsx` once the production domain is finalized.
- Service/value copy can be updated in `src/config/site.ts`; icons may be switched by selecting any Lucide icon key.

## Testing & Validation
- `npm run lint` – Passed after latest refinement.
- `npm run build` – Passed using the stable Webpack pipeline with self-hosted fonts.

## Follow-up Ideas
1. Add testimonials and project photos once available to provide social proof.
2. Introduce FAQs or pricing guidelines to pre-qualify leads.
3. Consider adding analytics (e.g., Vercel Analytics or Plausible) for engagement insights.
4. Connect the Formspree endpoint and verify spam protection (reCAPTCHA or honeypot) prior to go-live.
